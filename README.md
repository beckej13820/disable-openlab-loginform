# disable-openlab-loginform

This plugin is based on work done by Boone Gorges. Originally written into a plugin that had multiple uses, this plugin just takes the code to deactive Commons in a Box OpenLab's expanding loginbox.

This plugin will only be useful to networks running Commons in a Box OpenLab and must be installed in the mu-plugins folder. It was created for schools that are using CBOX OpenLab with SSO and needed to disable the default login methods.

To install place disable-openlab-loginform.php and the folder assets in the mu-plugins folder.
